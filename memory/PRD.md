# mTree — Product Requirements & Progress

## Original Problem Statement
Build a mobile app: import from https://github.com/clayjohnson706-art/mtreev3

## What is mTree
Android-first manifestation app. Core loop: **Goal + Intention (Deity) + Sacrifice = Manifestation**.
Users start a cycle-based manifestation, perform a daily "Hold to Manifest" ritual to grow their
streak/tree, can link a Hustle (side habit) and Fasting, and premium users get a Community Wall
to share/save others' completed manifestations.

## Architecture
- Frontend: Expo Router (React Native), TypeScript, MongoDB-backed FastAPI (`/api` prefix).
- Auth: Emergent-managed Google Sign-in (kept as-is per user choice) + a `dev-login` endpoint
  used only for automated testing (creates/fetches a `@*.mtree.dev`-style test user).
- Payments: `/api/subscribe` is an intentional STUB — every new user gets `is_premium=true`.
  No real Google Play Billing yet (user's explicit choice for this phase).
- Notifications: local on-device scheduling via `expo-notifications`, lazy-`require()`'d and
  wrapped in try/catch in `src/utils/notifications.ts` / `app/_layout.tsx` because the package
  throws at import time in Expo Go on Android (SDK53+ dropped remote-push there) — everything
  degrades to a safe no-op in that environment and works fully in a real dev/production build.

## Key Decisions / User Choices
- Import as-is, then continue building features.
- Keep Emergent-managed Google Sign-in.
- Keep `/api/subscribe` as a free stub for now.
- Translation LLM choice for the 22 Indian + global languages: **on hold**, user will supply
  content later — architecture is ready (`language` param + user preference saved), backend
  currently always serves English text for every language selection (explicit user decision).

## What's Been Implemented (dated)
**2026-07-19 — Import + fixes**
- Imported backend (`server.py`) + frontend (`app/`, `src/`) verbatim from GitHub.
- Installed missing deps: `react-native-svg`, `@gorhom/bottom-sheet`,
  `@react-native-community/datetimepicker`, `expo-notifications`.
- Purged all dev/test/bot users + fake wall entries from MongoDB; added a permanent
  `backend/tests/conftest.py` session-teardown fixture that auto-purges any `*mtree.dev` test
  user (and cascade data) after every pytest run, so the DB/Wall never accumulate test data again.
- 74/74 backend pytest passing.

**Feature additions (same day)**
1. Reminder system: local daily notifications (`src/utils/notifications.ts`), reminder frequency
   up to 10x/day, tap-to-open calming popup (`app/ritual-reminder.tsx`).
2. Home header "Reminder Center" bell icon (`testID=home-reminder-bell`) — visible once
   reminders have EVER been enabled for the active manifestation (`reminders_ever_enabled`
   sticky flag, backend), gold when currently on / muted-gray when off, never disappears once
   set. Tapping opens `src/components/ReminderCenter.tsx` (scrollable bottom sheet) with:
   instant enable/disable toggle, frequency chips, **Random vs Custom schedule modes**
   (`computeRandomReminderTimes` avoids busy hours + clustering; Custom lets the user pick each
   reminder's exact time), busy-hours (Do Not Disturb) editor, Save.
3. Hustle/Fasting home cards now visually match Goal/Sacrifice cards (matching border/radius).
4. Affirmation language selection: `LanguagePicker` (search bar, 53 languages — 22 official
   Indian languages + English + ~30 major global languages, native-name labels). Preference is
   saved (`affirmation_language`) but backend currently always serves English affirmation text
   for every language (explicit "not yet, translations later" decision) — no placeholder/partial
   translations left in code.
- Bug fix: ReminderCenter sheet is now wrapped in a `ScrollView` (was previously unscrollable
  when many chips/custom time rows made content taller than the sheet) — verified via Playwright
  with 10x custom-time reminders on a 375×667 viewport.

**2026-07-19 — Hold-to-Manifest fix + Categories/Affirmations/Onboarding/Language/Tooltip update**
1. **Hold to Manifest bug fix** (`app/(tabs)/home.tsx`): the previous implementation completed
   the ritual via a fixed `setTimeout` that fired 3.5s after press-down regardless of whether
   the user released early — `endHold()` only cancelled the Reanimated visual animations, never
   the timeout. Rewrote it so ritual completion is driven ONLY by the `withTiming` completion
   callback on `holdProgress` (`finished === true` fires `runOnJS(completeHoldRitual)`); an early
   release calls `cancelAnimation()`, which makes `finished === false`, so the ritual can no
   longer complete on a partial hold.
2. **Expanded categories + real per-category, per-language affirmations**: merged the
   user-provided `merged-1784482232744.json` (35 affirmation categories × 54 languages) into the
   app.
   - `GOAL_CATEGORIES` grew from 13 → 36 (added happiness, success, wisdom, gratitude, fitness,
     beauty, friendship, abundance, self_love, courage, patience, discipline, forgiveness,
     purpose, leadership, harmony, protection, focus, joy, healing, prosperity, inner_strength,
     positivity). Existing keys/emojis were kept as-is to avoid disrupting existing manifestations.
   - `SACRIFICE_CATEGORIES` grew from 13 → 37 (added smoking, complaining, jealousy, anger,
     excuses, self_doubt, comparing, screen_time, sugar, late_nights, impulse_buying,
     binge_watching, people_pleasing, perfectionism, mindless_scrolling, fast_food, caffeine,
     revenge, gambling, lying, drugs, porn, toxic_music, road_rage).
   - Backend: added `backend/data/affirmations_i18n.json` (curated data) + `AFFIRMATIONS_I18N`,
     `CATEGORY_ALIASES` (`relationship` → `love`, preserves old key), and `LANGUAGE_CODE_MAP`
     (frontend language slug → 2/3-letter data code). `/api/affirmations/{category}` now returns
     the real curated affirmation in the user's selected language (54 languages supported) with
     an English fallback, replacing the old English-only stub.
3. **Language reorder**: `LANGUAGES` in `theme/index.ts` now orders English → Hindi → all Global
   languages → all remaining Regional/Indian languages (was previously English → Hindi → Indian
   → Global).
4. **New onboarding** (`app/onboarding.tsx`): replaced the 5 old slides (incl. "The Sacred Tree"
   transformation slide) with 6 new slides — one per current feature: Set Your Goal, Choose Your
   Sacrifice, Daily Commitment (Hold to Manifest), Link Your Hustle, Fasting (Honor-Based), Daily
   Affirmations. Visual changed from `TreeHero` to a simple glowing emoji badge per slide.
5. **Tooltips removed**: deleted `src/components/FeatureTour.tsx` and all its wiring in
   `home.tsx` (`tourVisible` state, `finishTour`, first-run effect). `tour_done` field left as an
   unused, harmless leftover on the User model/DB (no migration needed).

**2026-07-19 — Re-imported into new environment**
- Imported full codebase (backend, frontend, memory, store_assets, tests) verbatim from
  `https://github.com/clayjohnson706-art/mtreev4` into this pod via `git clone` + rsync
  (excluded `.git`, `.emergent`, `node_modules`, `.env` files to preserve pod-specific config).
  Installed backend (`pip install -r requirements.txt`) and frontend (`yarn install`, fresh
  `yarn.lock` regenerated) dependencies. Fresh MongoDB instance (empty DB) in this pod.
- Testing agent: 74/74 backend pytest passing (fixed 2 stale test assertions that assumed old
  pre-i18n English-fallback affirmation behavior). Full frontend E2E smoke test passed: onboarding
  → deity → profile-setup → manifest-setup (goal/sacrifice/cycle/reminders/affirmation/hustle/
  fasting) → Hold-to-Manifest ritual → Wall → Settings, no errors. Test data cleaned up after run.

**2026-07-19 — Play Store launch prep: auth links, agreement checkbox, security fix, Admin Panel**
- Auth screen (`app/auth.tsx`): added tappable "Terms" (`.../mtreeapptermsandconditions/`) and
  "Privacy Policy" (`.../mtreeprivacypolicy/`) links, plus a mandatory agreement checkbox —
  "Continue with Google" is disabled (greyed) until the user checks it.
- **Security fix**: `/api/auth/dev-login` was previously open to ANY email (account-takeover risk
  if left live in production). Now gated behind `ENABLE_DEV_LOGIN=true` env var AND restricted to
  `@mtree.dev` emails only — safe by default, still usable for automated testing in this pod.
- **New Admin Panel** (backend `ADMIN_EMAILS` env var + `get_current_admin` dependency,
  `/api/admin/stats|users|manifestations` routes; frontend `app/admin.tsx`, entry point in
  Settings shown only when `user.is_admin`): stats dashboard (users/premium/active/completed/
  wall-post counts), searchable user list with detail modal (toggle premium, delete user +
  cascade data), Wall Posts tab (list + delete completed public manifestations). Admin access:
  `nextleveldev706@gmail.com` (real Google account, added to `ADMIN_EMAILS`).
- **Block/Unblock users**: Admin Panel user detail modal now has a "Block Access" section —
  block a user for 1/7/30 days or permanently (chips), or unblock instantly (green button).
  Backend (`POST /api/admin/users/{id}/block|unblock`) sets `is_blocked`/`blocked_until`;
  `get_current_user` rejects any request from a blocked user with 403 (even with a valid
  session token) and auto-clears expired temporary blocks. Frontend (`AuthContext`) detects
  this 403, force-logs the user out, and shows a dismissable "Your account has been blocked"
  banner on the auth screen. Backend: 105/105 pytest passing (11 new block/unblock tests).
- **Admin Panel v2 — full user control**: user list row now opens a full-screen "User Details"
  panel (not a small popup) with: inline-editable name, Public Profile toggle (now persists),
  Premium toggle + extend-by-days chips (+7/+30/+90/+365, stacks on active expiry) + Revoke
  Premium button, full Manifestations list per-user with individual delete, Force Logout (All
  Devices) button, Block Access (from prior round), and Delete User. Backend adds
  `PATCH .../users/{id}` name support + `POST .../extend-premium|revoke-premium|force-logout`.
  Backend: 117/117 pytest passing.
- **Admin self-protection**: admin accounts (`ADMIN_EMAILS`) are excluded from the Admin Panel
  users list entirely, and every mutating admin endpoint (delete/block/unblock/patch/
  extend-premium/revoke-premium/force-logout) rejects any attempt to target an admin's
  user_id with 400 "Cannot perform this action on an admin account" — defense in depth even
  if the id were guessed directly via API. Read-only detail fetch still works. Backend:
  130/130 pytest passing.

**2026-07-20 — Country detection + localized currency + admin donation tracking**
- Country detected automatically from device locale (`expo-localization`, no permission
  prompt) and pre-filled in onboarding's new Country field (below DOB); user can change via
  a searchable `CountryPicker` (also reachable later from Settings → REGION → Country).
  Saved to `user.country` (ISO2 code).
- Prices (Subscription page) and donation amounts (post-ritual donation flow) now display in
  the user's local currency using a fixed ~30-currency approximate exchange-rate table
  (`src/theme/currency.ts` frontend / `CURRENCY_RATE_PER_INR` + `to_usd()` backend, INR as
  base/pivot) — no live FX API, by explicit user choice since no real payment gateway exists
  yet. Donations are stored with both `donation_amount` and `donation_currency`.
  - Admin Panel: user list shows each user's country (flag + code); full detail view shows
  country (flag + name) and a new "DONATIONS" section with `Total Donated` converted to USD
  across all of that user's manifestations, for cross-user comparability.
  - Backend: 138/138 pytest passing (8 new tests). Frontend fully verified via testing agent,
  zero regressions on prior onboarding/admin panel functionality.

**2026-07-19 — Home screen layout + hold-ritual glow centering fix**
- Card order changed: Moon Phase + Cosmic Energy row → Daily Affirmation → Deity Hero →
  Daily Streak bar → Your Journey (affirmation moved above deity, below moon/cosmic).
- Deity Hero card slightly reduced in size (240 → 210) for a more compact home screen.
- Fixed a bug where the golden hold-energy glow during the "Hold to Start" ritual appeared
  visually off-center from the deity stone mid-hold, only snapping to center after completion.
  Root cause: the glow/seed (absolutely positioned) were siblings of the deity symbol AND the
  text labels below it inside one flex column — Yoga positions absolute children at the
  container's top-left by default (ignoring `justifyContent: center` on siblings), so they
  didn't align with the deity's true visual center once labels below shifted the "block"
  center down. Fix: wrapped glow + deity symbol + seed together in a dedicated
  `heroSymbolWrap` sized exactly to the deity, decoupled from the labels below.
- Verified via testing agent: correct order, smaller deity card, glow centered throughout
  the full 4s hold (checked at ~1s/2s/3s) and after completion. No regressions.
- Backend: 94/94 pytest passing (20 new admin/dev-login security tests added).
- Note: a REAL user (`mjrd1402@gmail.com`) has signed in via real Google OAuth and created a live
  manifestation in this environment — this is genuine data, not a test artifact; never delete it.

## Play Store Launch Notes
- Real Google Play Billing NOT set up yet (user has no merchant/payments profile) — `/api/subscribe`
  stays a free stub for initial launch. Steps when ready: create app draft in Play Console (no AAB
  needed yet) → Monetize → Payments profile (merchant account) → Monetize → Products (subscriptions)
  → then wire up billing library + backend receipt verification.
- New personal Play Console developer accounts (created after Nov 2023) need a **closed test with
  12 testers opted in for 14 continuous days** before Production access unlocks.
- No built-in DB viewer on Emergent — use the Admin Panel (`/admin` in-app) or code-editor terminal
  (mongo shell) to inspect data. Future updates after Play Store launch require rebuilding via the
  Emergent "Publish" button and uploading the new build as a new Play Console release (no separate
  OTA channel in this setup).

## Prioritized Backlog / Next Steps
- P0: User will self-test the above 5 changes (explicitly asked to skip testing_agent this round).
- P1: Real Google Play Billing integration when user is ready to move off the payments stub.
- P1: Real English-first non-affirmation content translations (menus, UI copy) if ever requested —
  affirmations themselves are now fully translated across 54 languages.
- P1: Regenerate store_assets/screenshots for Play Store listing (user will provide later).
- P1: Shareable "streak milestone" card (e.g. Day 7/21/40 streak) to boost word-of-mouth —
  user acknowledged interest, explicitly deferred to a later session, not yet built.
- P2: Push/local notification reliability testing on a real Android build (Expo Go can't fully
  validate closed-app/reboot delivery).

**2026-07-20 — Onboarding back-button lockdown, timezone-based country detection, fixed donation tiers**
- **Onboarding/profile-setup back-button bypass fix**: `BackHandler` added to `onboarding.tsx`
  (slide 1: double-tap-within-2s to exit app + in-app "Press back again to exit" toast, incl.
  `ToastAndroid` on Android; slides 2-6: back goes to the previous slide instead of exiting),
  `profile-setup.tsx` (hardware back fully blocked — mandatory, never reused as an "edit
  profile" screen), and `deity.tsx` (blocked only during first-time onboarding when
  `!user.profile_done`; normal back allowed when reached later from Settings to change deity).
  Root `_layout.tsx` also disables the iOS swipe-back gesture on `onboarding` and
  `profile-setup`. Native-only (`BackHandler` has a safe no-op shim on web) — cannot be
  verified via Expo web preview/Playwright, requires an Android device/emulator.
- **Country detection fix**: `detectDeviceCountry()` in `src/theme/currency.ts` now checks the
  device **timezone** first (via `Localization.getCalendars()[0].timeZone`, mapped through a
  new `TIMEZONE_COUNTRY` table for ~50 zones) before falling back to locale region code, then
  "US" as a last resort. Fixes the root cause: many Android phones (common in India/SE Asia)
  ship with display language "English (United States)" regardless of actual location, which
  made the old locale-only check always report US.
- **Fixed donation tiers**: `success.tsx` donation step replaced the free-text amount input
  with 6 fixed INR tier buttons (₹101/₹201/₹501/₹1,001/₹10,001/₹50,001), each displayed in the
  user's localized currency via `formatPrice()`. Bug found + fixed during testing: backend's
  `donation_amount` is a strict `int`, but `convertFromINR()` can return a float for most
  non-INR currencies — fixed by sending `Math.max(1, Math.round(convertFromINR(...)))` (floor
  of 1 unit so very-low-value currencies like KWD/BHD/OMR never round down to a "free" 0).
- Also clarified via investigation: a reported Google Sign-In "disallowed_useragent" error was
  traced to the user testing with "Via Browser" (a proxy/compression browser Google blocks for
  all OAuth, not an app bug) — works fine in Brave/Chrome/Safari. No code change needed/made.
- Backend: 138/138 pytest passing, unchanged (no backend code touched this session) + 18/18
  new donation-rounding regression tests added by testing agent. Frontend verified via testing
  agent (donation tier UI + rounding fix confirmed working end-to-end); BackHandler-based
  back-button blocking explicitly flagged as untestable in this environment (native-only).

**2026-07-20 — Deity-selection "stuck screen" fix (real user report)**
- Real user (`mjrd1402@gmail.com`) reported: logged in, saw the onboarding tutorial twice, then
  got permanently stuck on deity selection (Continue did nothing). Root cause (pre-existing bug,
  unrelated to same-day changes above): `deity.tsx`'s `confirm()` called `router.back()`
  whenever `profile_done` was already true, assuming this screen is only ever reached via
  `router.push` from Settings (which has back history) — but when reached through the
  onboarding redirect chain (all `router.replace`, no back history), `router.back()` silently
  no-ops, leaving no way forward.
- Fix: `if (router.canGoBack()) router.back(); else router.replace("/(tabs)/home")`. Verified
  by DB check that the affected real account's data was already fully correct
  (onboarding_done/deity_id/profile_done all set) — a fresh app reopen alone would also have
  unstuck them; the code fix prevents recurrence for any user who lands here without back
  history. Verified via testing agent: bug-repro scenario now reaches Home, "change deity from
  Settings" still correctly returns to Settings (no regression), full fresh-onboarding path
  unaffected.

## Test Credentials
See `/app/memory/test_credentials.md` — dev-login endpoint for automated testing, real account
`mjrd1402@gmail.com` (Google-only, preserved, not to be used for automated login attempts), and
admin account `nextleveldev706@gmail.com` (real Google sign-in required, no dev-login).

**2026-07-20 — 3 feature updates: Journey intro, deity alignment fix, ritual-reminder card**
1. **First-Time Journey Guidance**: new `app/journey-intro.tsx` — 3 swipeable cards ("Your
   Journey Starts Now", "Keep Your Promise" with 4 bullets, "You're Ready") shown exactly once,
   right after a user's very FIRST manifest-setup completion, before they ever reach the Home
   ritual button. "Got It" on card 3 sets `journey_intro_seen=true` (new backend User field,
   added to `UserProfile`/`ProfileUpdate` models + both user-creation paths) and routes to Home.
   `manifest-setup.tsx`'s `submit()` checks this flag to decide journey-intro vs. straight-to-
   home. Added to root Stack with `gestureEnabled:false` (same as onboarding/profile-setup).
2. **Deity selection alignment fix**: removed the asymmetric `rowOffset` (`marginLeft: 42`) that
   was only applied to the middle row of the 3-2-2 deity grid, causing visible misalignment.
   Rows now rely on the parent's `alignItems:"center"` + `justifyContent:"center"` on each row
   to auto-center evenly regardless of item count.
3. **Improved Ritual Reminder card** (`app/ritual-reminder.tsx`, shown when tapping a local
   reminder notification): now shows a GOAL pill and a SACRIFICE pill (emoji + label, custom
   text fallback) alongside the real affirmation text (if enabled) and a new rotating
   sacrifice-commitment line ("Don't give up on your sacrifice...", etc.). No-active-
   manifestation case still shows the plain fallback message, no pills, no crash.
- Verified via testing agent: 6 new backend pytest tests (100% pass), full Playwright regression
  of the entire flow (auth→onboarding→deity→profile-setup→home→manifest-setup→journey-intro→
  home) plus targeted ritual-reminder scenarios. No bugs found. New test file:
  `backend/tests/test_journey_intro_and_ritual_reminder.py`.

**2026-07-20 — Journey-intro redesign: compact premium cards + illustrated final card**
- User feedback on the journey-intro feature: convert from full-page slides into small,
  centered, card-style slides (dimmed background overlay behind a single compact `Card`), split
  into 5 cards instead of 3 so text isn't crowded (4 content cards + 1 final card), and make the
  final card clearly guide the user to their first action.
- Cards: "Your Journey Starts Now" → "Keep Your Promise" → "Stay On Track" → "Never Miss a
  Moment" → final "You're Ready" card with a mock illustration of the Home screen's actual
  Hold-to-Start button (fingerprint icon + "HOLD TO START" text in a gold-bordered pill) plus a
  caption pointing the user back to Home. Index-based state switching (not horizontal
  paging/swipe) since card content/height now varies (the final card has the illustration).
  Same backend flag/routing logic as before (`journey_intro_seen`), unchanged.
- Fixed a layout bug found during self-testing before handoff: the Next/Got It button used
  `alignSelf:"stretch"` which anchored it to the left edge instead of centering under the card —
  changed to `width:"100%"` (no alignSelf override) so it centers via the parent's
  `alignItems:"center"`, matching the card above it.
- Verified via testing agent (measured bounding boxes to confirm button-center = card-center =
  viewport-center): all 5 cards render correct content/titles, button label switches
  correctly, "Got It" persists `journey_intro_seen=true` and navigates to Home, no regression on
  first/second-manifestation routing, deity alignment, or ritual-reminder pills.

**2026-07-20 — Journey Cards moved to Home overlay; ritual-complete popup removed; onboarding
tap-transition smoothness fix**
1. **Journey Cards → Home overlay**: extracted the card content from the (now-deleted)
   `app/journey-intro.tsx` route into `src/components/JourneyIntroOverlay.tsx`, rendered as a
   `Modal` overlay ON the Home screen (`app/(tabs)/home.tsx`) instead of a separate navigated-to
   screen. Trigger: `useEffect` watching `active` (manifestation loaded) + `!user.journey_intro_seen`
   — fires the first time a user reaches Home with an active manifestation, same one-time
   backend flag as before (unchanged). `manifest-setup.tsx` now always routes straight to
   `/(tabs)/home` (no more conditional `/journey-intro` redirect). Removed the route's
   `Stack.Screen` entry from `_layout.tsx`.
2. **Removed the "Ritual Completed" popup**: deleted the `showRitual` Modal, its state,
   entrance-animation shared values (`ritualPopScale/Opacity`), and now-unused styles from
   `home.tsx` — completing a ritual is now silent (streak/button state still updates), since the
   Journey Cards overlay already covers the needed guidance.
3. **Onboarding tap-vs-swipe transition fix** (`app/onboarding.tsx`): `goNext()` and the
   hardware-back handler no longer call `setIdx()` immediately after `scrollTo()` — `idx` is now
   updated exclusively by the existing `onScroll` handler (fired by the native scroll animation
   the same way for both tap and swipe), so the dot indicator/title/background transition at the
   identical pace regardless of input method (previously tap made them jump ahead of the
   still-animating scroll).
- Verified via testing agent: overlay trigger/dismiss + persistence correct, no
  "ritual-complete-card" anywhere in the DOM after completing a ritual, and empirically confirmed
  `idx` no longer jumps instantly on tap (checked DOM at 30ms then 600ms after tap). No bugs found.

**2026-07-20 — Fixed: Journey Cards overlay never appeared (trigger bug)**
- Root cause: the trigger required an active manifestation (`if (active && !user.journey_intro_seen)`),
  but `profile-setup.tsx` routes straight to `/(tabs)/home` — a brand-new user's TRUE first Home
  visit happens BEFORE they've ever created a manifestation (Home shows "Begin New
  Manifestation" at that point, not Hold-to-Start). `active` was null then, so the overlay could
  never fire — last session's test happened to pre-create a manifestation via direct API call,
  which accidentally masked this exact bug.
- Fix: trigger now fires purely on `!user.journey_intro_seen` (no `active` dependency) in
  `home.tsx`. `JourneyIntroOverlay` now takes a `hasActiveManifestation` prop so its final card
  adapts: shows "BEGIN NEW MANIFESTATION" guidance (pointing at that Home button) when no
  manifestation exists yet, or "HOLD TO START" (as before) when one already does.
- Verified via testing agent: reproduced the exact real-user flow (onboarding/profile done, zero
  manifestations) — overlay now fires correctly on that first visit with the adaptive final card,
  persists `journey_intro_seen=true`, never reappears; original with-manifestation scenario still
  passes too. No bugs found.

**2026-07-20 — Fixed (3rd attempt): Journey Cards fired prematurely + duplicate final-card variant**
- User report: cards were appearing immediately after login/before onboarding (for pre-existing
  test users who'd already completed onboarding in an earlier session), and there were TWO
  different final-card endings ("Hold to Start" vs the previous session's "Begin New
  Manifestation" adaptive variant), perceived as two duplicate flows.
- Root cause: the previous session's fix triggered the overlay on ANY first Home visit purely
  based on `!user.journey_intro_seen` — with no way to distinguish "just finished onboarding,
  no manifestation yet" from "just finished manifest-setup" other than the now-removed adaptive
  final card, which itself caused the "two flows" confusion.
- Fix: replaced ALL state-inference with a fully deterministic one-time navigation param.
  `manifest-setup.tsx`'s `submit()` now does
  `router.replace({ pathname: "/(tabs)/home", params: { showJourneyIntro: "1" } })` — but only
  on a user's first-ever manifestation completion (`!user.journey_intro_seen`). `home.tsx` reads
  this via `useLocalSearchParams` and shows the overlay ONLY when the param is present (then
  immediately clears it via `router.setParams`) — nothing else can trigger it, eliminating any
  ambiguity about timing. `JourneyIntroOverlay` reverted to a single, consistent 5-card sequence
  always ending with "HOLD TO START" — the adaptive "Begin New Manifestation" variant was
  removed entirely (there is now exactly ONE Journey Cards experience).
- Verified via testing agent (5 scenarios including the real manifest-setup wizard UI end-to-end,
  not just simulated params): no premature firing on a plain Home visit, correct firing via the
  param, single consistent card sequence, persistence + no-reappear all pass. No bugs found.

**2026-07-20 — Fixed: Journey Cards looked like a separate opaque page, not a modal overlay**
- Root cause: `JourneyIntroOverlay.tsx` rendered a full `<AnimatedBackground>` starfield plus a
  solid `backgroundColor: COLORS.void` on its container INSIDE the (already-transparent) React
  Native `Modal` — this made the whole thing opaque, completely hiding the real Home screen
  still mounted/rendered behind it, so it looked like a full-screen navigated page instead of a
  dialog overlay.
- Fix: removed `AnimatedBackground` and the opaque void background entirely; the Modal's
  container is now a single semi-transparent dark backdrop (`rgba(0,0,0,0.72)`), so Home's real
  content (moon phase, cosmic energy, affirmation, streak, Hold to Start button, tab bar) stays
  fully visible/legible (dimmed) behind the centered rounded card — a proper premium modal feel.
- Verified via testing agent (screenshot-based): Home's content confirmed visible/dimmed behind
  the overlay, "Got It" closes in-place with no navigation/reload, card sequence/trigger timing
  unchanged and still correct. No bugs found.

**2026-07-20 — Changed: Journey Cards now recur every new manifestation (not one-time-only)**
- User clarified intended behavior: the overlay should reappear EVERY time a user starts a NEW
  manifestation journey (completes manifest-setup and taps "Start Manifestation"), not just
  their very first one ever — a recurring reminder of their commitment before each new journey.
- Change: `manifest-setup.tsx`'s `submit()` now unconditionally passes the
  `?showJourneyIntro=1` redirect param (previously gated on `!user.journey_intro_seen`).
  `home.tsx`'s trigger effect no longer checks/gates on `user.journey_intro_seen` at all — it
  fires purely off the one-time navigation param, still never during login/onboarding/plain Home
  visits. `JourneyIntroOverlay.tsx` no longer persists `journey_intro_seen` on "Got It" (no
  longer meaningful since it's not one-time). The backend `journey_intro_seen` field still
  exists in the User model but is now vestigial/unused for gating — left in place to minimize
  risk, not removed.
- Also fixed a real bug found during this session's manual testing: calling
  `router.setParams()` synchronously in the same effect that fires on the very first render
  could throw "Attempted to navigate before mounting the Root Layout" when landing directly on
  `/home?showJourneyIntro=1` — deferred via `setTimeout(..., 0)` to fix.
- Verified via testing agent: direct-param test (overlay shows despite `journey_intro_seen=true`),
  regression (plain `/home` never shows it), and — most importantly — ran the REAL manifest-setup
  wizard UI twice for the same user (2 separate manifestations) and confirmed the overlay
  correctly reappeared both times. Zero console errors. No bugs found.

**2026-07-20 — Re-imported into a new pod from mtreev5 repo**
- Fresh `git clone` of `https://github.com/clayjohnson706-art/mtreev5` (rsync'd into `/app`,
  excluding `.git`, `.emergent`, `node_modules`, `.env` files to preserve pod-specific config).
  Fresh empty MongoDB in this pod (no real user data yet).
- Installed backend (`pip install -r requirements.txt`) + frontend (`yarn install`) deps.
- backend/.env: added `ENABLE_DEV_LOGIN=true` and `ADMIN_EMAILS=nextleveldev706@gmail.com` so
  dev-login/admin panel work in this pod (values match original PRD history).
- Verified via testing agent: 103/151 pytest passing (8 skipped, 45 admin-panel test errors
  expected — they require the real admin account to log in once via Google OAuth in this fresh
  pod first, not a regression). Full frontend E2E walkthrough passed (onboarding → deity →
  profile-setup → manifest-setup → Home → Hold-to-Manifest ritual verified correct → Settings →
  Community Wall), no crashes. Minor doc-only fix: `test_credentials.md` corrected to show
  dev-login takes query params, not a JSON body. Test data cleaned up post-test.
- User's stated intent: import as-is first, review, then request new features next.

**2026-07-20 (Re-import into new pod, this session) — Imported from mtreev6**
- Fresh `git clone` of `https://github.com/clayjohnson706-art/mtreev6` (rsync'd into `/app`,
  excluding `.git`, `.emergent`, `node_modules`, `.env` files to preserve pod-specific config).
  Fresh empty MongoDB in this pod. Installed backend deps (already matched requirements.txt)
  and new frontend deps via `yarn expo install` (`@gorhom/bottom-sheet`,
  `@react-native-community/datetimepicker`, `expo-localization`, `expo-notifications`,
  `expo-sharing`, `react-native-svg`, `react-native-view-shot`, `html2canvas`).
  `backend/.env`: added `ENABLE_DEV_LOGIN=true`, `ADMIN_EMAILS=nextleveldev706@gmail.com`.
- Testing agent: 105/105 non-admin-gated backend pytest passing (45 admin-panel test errors
  expected — require the real admin to sign in once via Google OAuth in this fresh pod, not a
  regression). Full frontend E2E via dev-login bypass: auth → onboarding → deity → profile-setup
  → manifest-setup → Home → performed real Hold-to-Manifest ritual (streak persisted correctly)
  → Settings → Community Wall. No crashes.
- Fixed 2 low-priority cosmetic issues found by testing agent: (1) `profile-setup.tsx` now
  re-syncs name/gender/dob/country via `useEffect` when `user` resolves asynchronously after
  mount (previously only read once at mount, missed on deep-link/fast-reload); (2)
  `settings.tsx` `rowValue` style changed from a percentage `maxWidth` (which computed oddly
  inside an un-sized nested wrapper View) to `flexShrink` + `textAlign:"right"`, fixing
  unnecessary truncation of the Name row value.
- User's stated intent: import as-is first, review, then request new features next.

**2026-07-20 — Bug fix: onboarding "Next"/"Continue" button unresponsive on real Android device**
- User report (Expo Go, brand-new install, real Android phone): stuck on onboarding slide 1
  ("Set Your Goal"), tapping "Next" did nothing at all. Screenshot confirmed.
- Root cause (confirmed via web research): known React Native New Architecture regression
  (RN #51621, Reanimated #5977) — `TouchableOpacity`'s `onPress` (fires on touch-release) can
  silently stop responding on Android when nearby continuously-animating Reanimated views are
  present. Every onboarding/auth/etc. screen renders `<AnimatedBackground>` (infinite
  `withRepeat` blob/star animations) behind the button — exact trigger condition. App has
  `newArchEnabled: true` + Reanimated v4 + react-native-worklets, matching the regression's
  requirements. Not reproducible on web (onPress fires fine there).
- Fix: `FilledButton` + `GhostButton` (`src/components/ui.tsx`, used app-wide for primary CTAs)
  and the raw "Skip" button (`onboarding.tsx`) now wire their `onPress` prop to the
  `TouchableOpacity`'s `onPressIn` (fires on touch-down, unaffected by the regression) — the
  officially recommended workaround. `Chip` deliberately left untouched (used inside
  horizontal-scrolling category pickers elsewhere; `onPressIn` there risks misfiring during
  scroll gestures — out of scope for this bug).
- Verified via testing agent (realistic press-and-hold-then-release simulation, since instant
  `.click()` doesn't trigger `onPressIn` on RN Web — a Playwright-only artifact, not a real-user
  issue): full onboarding (6 slides) → paywall → deity → profile-setup flow works, no
  double-fire on rapid double-tap, no regression on untouched Chip components.
- **Follow-up**: user reported the exact same symptom persisting after the above fix (no splash,
  no auth screen, straight to onboarding, every single time, even after a fresh QR rescan).
  Added a defensive fix in `_layout.tsx`: explicit `initialRouteName="index"` + explicit
  `<Stack.Screen name="index" />` on the root `<Stack>` (previously only `onboarding` and
  `profile-setup` were explicitly declared as children, which was a latent ambiguity risk for
  the navigator's initial route resolution). Testing agent re-verified full flow end-to-end with
  no regressions (cold load correctly lands on `/auth`).
  **Actual root cause (confirmed by user): a stale/corrupted Expo Go client cache on their
  phone** — fully uninstalling and reinstalling the Expo Go app itself (not just clearing the
  in-app QR/rescan) resolved it completely. Not a code bug. The `initialRouteName` change
  remains in the codebase as a harmless defensive safeguard.
